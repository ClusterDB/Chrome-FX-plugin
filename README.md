# Chrome-FX-plugin

This Chrome extension finds an input element named `exchangeRate` in the current web page, and then it increases its value by 5%. 

If you want to use a different % then edit `extensions/popup.js`.

1. Enable the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner.

1. Click on the "Increase Exchange Rate" button in the toolbar, and the value of the input element will be increased by 5%.
